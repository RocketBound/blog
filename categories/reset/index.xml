      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have experienced the first taste of failure on this journey. After 4 days of abstinence, I allowed myself to fall into a vulnerable position which ended in disappointment. The initial trigger was a post on reddit by someone who was about to start the recovery process. The post described a type of material that I had not previously known about, erotic hypnosis. I was curious about what it would be like, and started searching and listening to content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was resisting the urges at first, but my mindset changed in an instant. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to describe how sudden and irreversably your thoughts can change in a moment. The end result was mixed with so much disappointment that is was not enjoyable or even satisfying. The chaser effect has been with me for the last week, and I have been avoiding resuming the journey. I can feel the negative emotions taking hold again. The positive thoughts from day 4 seem very far away.&lt;/p&gt;
