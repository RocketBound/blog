The first time I encountered the idea that masturabation could have negative effects was during the summer of 2013. I had accidentally stumbled upon a community on reddit known as [nofap](http://reddit.com/r/nofap). This is a comunity where individuals can discuss the impact that masturbation is having on their lives, and encourage each other through recovery. I took some time to read a few of the more popular threads, and left feeling defensive. I admired the commitment of people belonging to this community, but of course, I did not have a problem with porn or masturbation.

I didn't think about this addiction again until the start of 2014. It dawned on me that some of my personal issues, such as social anxiety, could originate from my frequent masturbation. I was still not fully on board. I had a porn collection of hundreds of videos, thousands of images that had taken time to compile. I had an inexplicable attachment to some of this content. I decided that it would be better to keep my favourite content and delete the rest. My collection halved from 750GB to 300GB, but was no less tempting.

My first serious step forward was in June 2014. My family were on vacation, and I had the house to myself for an entire week. I felt disappointed in myself that the only plan I had for this time was to masturbate. The desire to change was strong enough for me to delete my porn collection. This would have been unthinkable several months prior.

I have not made much progress in the last 6 months. The last 4 months have been tough, and I am unable to recall a time where I abstained for more than 3 days. These writings are a way to keep me from fooling myself. It's not OK to delay recovery for another day, because that is how years pass by.
